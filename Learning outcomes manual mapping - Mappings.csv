For Blooms level, the word discern is similar to differentiate. But the verb differentiate is mapped to 2 solo levels being understanding and analysing. The word propose maps to the Blooms level creating. Since this is a level 1 unit, Creating and analysing wont be appropriate for this level, therefore, Understanding would be the most appropriate Bloom's level.",,Multistructural,Understanding,There is a good spread of all levels for Blooms but the SOLO levels majority are Multistructural. ,,,,Example of simple and easily mapped LO,,,,,Unistructural,Knowledge

Discern doesnt appear in the verbs list for Bloom's. Evaluating is too far in the list so it wont be considered.

This feels like a very simple LO. Identify is used in Remembering, Understanding, Analysing and Applying in Bloom's, and Unistructural in SOLO. Select is used in 5 Bloom levels, 1-5, and Multistructural in SOLO. Derive does not appear in either taxonomy using the current samples. Based on the levels of the verbs and the fact that the unit is a level 1 unit, this learning outcome is mapped to Remembering (Bloom) and Unistructural (SOLO).",,Unistructural,Remembering,Most of the LOs are in the lower half of the taxonomy levels.

,LO2,Apply mathematical techniques to solve engineering problems.,"Apply, Solve","Relational, Extended Abstract","Applying, Analysing","The sentence begins with the verb Apply, but 'Solve' appears towards the end of the sentence. Apply is categorised as Applying under Blooms and Relational in SOLO. Solve is Applying and Analysing in Bloom's, and Relational and Extended Abstract in SOLO. The sentence could possibly be rewritten with 'Use' rather than 'Apply' but the taxonomy levels are the same.

ENG1013 - Engineering Smart Systems,LO1,Discuss requirements of a smart system from component to integrated perspective.,Discuss,Multistructural,Understanding,This sentence is a simple sentence and only contains one verb.

Define correlates to Remembering (Bloom) and Unistructural (SOLO). Describe correlates to Multistructural (SOLO) and Remembering, Understanding and Evaluating in Bloom's.

In Bloom, Propose is Creating, Design is Evaluating and Creating, and Evaluate is Analysing, Evaluating, Creating. In the context of the sentence, Design does not feel like it is a verb that should be considered when mapping.  As a level 1 unit, Creating feels like too high a level to map too, therefore only considering the verbs Propose and Evaluate, the LO is mapped to Evaluating.

,LO5,Identify appropriate engineering tools and techniques to develop and validate a solution.,"Identify, Develop, Validate",Unistructural,"Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analysing, Creating","The verb Validate doesn't appear in any of the sample verbs. Identify is Unistructural (SOLO) and Remembering through Analysing (Bloom). Develop doesn't appear in SOLO, but is Applying and Creating in Bloom. The main purpose of this LO is to Identify tools to do other tasks so emphasis is placed on this verb.

However, because the LO introduces ""select"" as a second verb (for another clause) which can be a verb for all of the first 5 levels of Bloom, the exact level can be difficult to tell. However, since there is overlap for the most part over evaluating in Bloom and Multistructural in SOLO, this is what i'm inclined to map towards.",,Multistructural,Evaluating,"One clearly good mapping, but a lot of the LOs are hard to classify and more are less fall into similar SOLO/Bloom levels.",,,,,,,,,,

""Determine"" and ""Design"" still overlap with one another in evaluating (Bloom), but it's much harder to tell which SOLO level it is as ""Determine"" falls under Multistructural and ""Design"" falls under Extended Abstract.
