ENG1012 - Engineering Design,LO1,"Discern fundamental chemical, materials, mechanical and environmental engineering knowledge, principles and concepts to propose solutions to a humanitarian engineering problem.","Discern, propose",Multistructural,"Understanding, Analysiing, Creating","For the SOLO level, the mapping here is straighforward as the two verbs identified both correspond to the Multistructural level. For Blooms level, the word discern is similar to differentiate. But the verb differentiate is mapped to 2 solo levels being understanding and analysing. The word propose maps to the Blooms level creating. Since this is a level 1 unit, Creating and analysing wont be appropriate for this level, therefore, Understanding would be the most appropriate Bloom's level.",,Multistructural,Understanding,There is a good spread of all levels for Blooms but the SOLO levels majority are Multistructural. ,,,,Example of simple and easily mapped LO,,,,,Unistructural,Knowledge
,LO2,Identify design requirements from a provided brief and analyse potential solutions using first principles of mathematics and natural and engineering sciences.,"Identify, analyse","Unistructural, Relational","Remembering, Applying, analysing","For the SOLO level, it would map to Relational because looking at the LO, it is required to analyse some principles. At this level, Unistructural level wouldnt be enough so Relational is a more suitable mapping. Based on the solo mapping, it would also be ideal to map the Bloom's level also to analysing level. ",,Relational,Analysing,,,,,Somewhat difficult to map or interesting use case,,,,,Multistructural,Comprehension
,LO3,"Identify societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues relevant to your project including the Indigenous context, and your consequent responsibilities as an engineer.",Identify,Unistructural ,"Remembering, Applying, analysing","The mapping to SOLO is straightforward which is to Unistructural. For the Blooms level, the LO;s are being mapped 3 different levels. But looking at the SOLO mapping, since it is unistructural, the most ideal similar level mapping would be Remembering.",,Unistructural,Remembering,,,,,Difficult to map and presents edge case,,,,,Relational,Apply
